# Shakespeare ML Demo

I wrote this app to learn Marklogic, as well as it's json support

It is NOT complete as of yet, and is full of both architectural and functional bugs.

## Install and see it run

clone this git repo to a local directory.

download marklogic, and install the Shakespreare sample data.  Point the Marklogic install to the cloned git repo.

run bower install to add the runtime dependencies. (Don't have bower?  install it with npm first.)

Navigate to [http://localhost:8010/shakes.html](http://localhost:8010/shakes.html) or whereever you installed Marklogic, and take it from there.
